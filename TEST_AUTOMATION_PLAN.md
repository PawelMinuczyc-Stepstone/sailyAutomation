```

### 1.3 Playwright Configuration
- Multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing
- Parallel test execution
- Screenshot/video capture on failures
- Test reporting (HTML, JUnit)

## Phase 2: Site Analysis & Exploration

### 2.1 Initial Site Reconnaissance
- Use Playwright MCP server to explore saily.com/pl
- Identify main user journeys and critical functionality
- Document page structure and key elements
- Analyze forms, navigation, and interactive components

### 2.2 Test Scenario Identification
Based on typical e-commerce/service sites, likely scenarios:
- Homepage functionality
- Product/service browsing
- Search functionality
- User registration/login
- Contact forms
- Language/region switching
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance benchmarks

## Phase 3: Test Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Test Categorization
- **Smoke Tests**: Critical path validation
- **Functional Tests**: Feature-specific testing
- **Cross-browser Tests**: Compatibility validation
- **Mobile Tests**: Responsive design validation
- **Performance Tests**: Page load and interaction timing
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance checks

### 3.2 Page Object Model Implementation
- Create reusable page classes
- Implement common actions and assertions
- Maintain locator strategies
- Handle dynamic content and waiting strategies

### 3.3 Test Data Management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Test user credentials management
- Mock data for various scenarios
- API response fixtures if needed

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance

### 4.1 Best Practices Implementation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Test isolation and cleanup
- Proper assertions and validations

### 4.2 Reporting & Documentation
- Comprehensive test reports
- Failed test screenshots/videos
- Test execution metrics
- Maintenance documentation

## Phase 5: CI/CD Integration

### 5.1 GitHub Actions Setup
- Automated test execution on PR/push
- Multi-environment testing
- Test result reporting
- Artifact collection (screenshots, videos)

### 5.2 Monitoring & Maintenance
- Regular test execution scheduling
- Test stability monitoring
- Performance regression detection
- Maintenance alerts for failing tests
